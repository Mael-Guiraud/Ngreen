ABSTRACT="We model the end to end delay and energy efficiency in the optical network
architecture NGREEN . As the architecture is based on an optical ring, the
random part of the delay comes from the random times needed to build an
optical container from arriving Data Units and the insertion of the optical
container on the ring. We first build a DTMC (Discrete Time Markov Chain)
to model the filling of the optical container with Data Units. We take into
account a deadline (to have a small latency) and a constraint on a minimal
filling of the container (to be energy efficient). We obtain through a
numerical analysis using an ad-hoc algorithm we proved, the distribution of
the container filling and the distribution of the time needed to build a
container. Then, we use this distribution to model the inter arrival of
optical containers at a station on the ring. Through simulations and
numerical analysis of Markov chains, we obtain the insertion delays and the
occupancy of the queue before insertion. The relevance of the paper is to
propose a trade-off between energy efficiency and latency for both
opportunistic and reservation insertion modes into the ring."
